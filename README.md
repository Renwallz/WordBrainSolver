# WordBrainSolver
Solver for the popular app Word Brain, because I enjoyed scripting a solver more than paying for hints :)

## To use:
Download both python files. You will also need a wordlist, you can find them almost anywhere. For now you will need to modify wordDict to point to your wordlist.

Alter the grid in wordbrain.py and then run it. It should print out all the possible answers.

## Future
This will get improved to be pep8 friendy, as well as a good excuse for me to finally learn some GUI programming. Oh, and much easier to use, too.
